# Out-Domain Examples

Proof of concept for the paper: [Out-domain examples for generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02926).
The code will be released soon ....

The inference behavior of a generative model can be influenced on test-time by an adversarial input.  An attacker can force a pre-trained generator to reproduce an arbitrary output if fed by a suitable latent representation. We call this output a **Out-Domain example**.
